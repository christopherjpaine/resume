      Worked in a small team to develop a wireless 3D tracking technology for the realtime collection of sports data. Joined the company 
      at an early stage of development, oversaw the succesful release of the product to market and acheived promotion to senior level.
      \begin{cvitems}
        \item{Worked with a complicated embedded stack that widened the scope of my coding ability. The stack our team maintained is comprised of 4 applications:}
        \begin{cvitems}
          \item{Server Side application to offload data from the network over USB and aggregate, process and publish data streams for cloud connections.}
          \item{FreeRTOS application on the wireless device to manage the device state and collect sensor data.}
          \item{Bare-metal application optimised to control the radio IC and manage connection to the TDMA network.}
          \item{Python based integration, production and unit testing framework - which I took a lead role in design and implementation of.}
        \end{cvitems}
        \item{Gained experience in a fast-paced and dynamic start-up environment. Improving my ability to write flexible code to handle rapidly changing and evolving specifications.}
        \item{Trained and supervised the junior engineers, whilst also leading the development of coding practices that create a more approachable stack for new starters.}
        \item{Developed the skills necessary to work with wireless networks. Putting these into practice by designing and building tools that aided debugging of wireless devices.}
