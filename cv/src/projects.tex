      Long running passion project developing an effective sound-to-light algorithm and platform based around an STM32F7.
      \begin{cvitems} % Description(s) of experience/contributions/knowledge
        \item {Developed a fully asynchronous DMX receiver to provide an interface capable of professional integration.}
        \item {Complex signal processing pipeline utilising DTFT, IIR/FIR implementations from the CMSIS-DSP library and some custom algorithms.}
        \item {Python simulation of the same pipeline to aid in debug and development of the algorithm.}
        \item {High-speed asynchronous LED driver suitable for scaling to variable LED arrays.}
        \item {Prototype hardware platform that was successfully demonstrated at Amsterdam Dance Event in 2023.}

    {2012-2018}
    {Designed and built a small (yet mighty!) sound system in Leeds to hire out for parties, and events.
    \begin{cvitems}
        \item Researched and developed designs for loudspeaker enclosures, using programs like winISD to simulate designs.
        \item Practical end-user experience of Digital Signal Processing for Audio.
        \item Repaired broken equipment; amplifiers, mixers, turntables.
        \item Managed bookings, logistics and finances for the business.
        \item System is now set to be installed at a community centre in London, providing an asset to teach young people about live sound.
