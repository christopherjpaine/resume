\begin{cvletter}

\lettersection{About Me}
I’ve recently returned from a three-month career break spent travelling, and I’m now looking for a fresh challenge that allows me to grow both personally and professionally. I’m based in London but open to relocating to find that opportunity, and I’m eager to join a team where I can deepen my expertise, work on new platforms, and make strong technical contributions.

I bring a solid foundation in embedded development, built across several industries, and I thrive in collaborative environments. I’ve often been recognised for bringing energy to teams, helping others feel included, and supporting junior engineers through informal mentorship.

Outside of work, I’m passionate about music and audio technology, enjoy woodworking and hands-on projects, and find balance through time outdoors; whether that’s cycling, skiing or hiking.

\lettersection{Why Bragi?}
I came across Bragi while looking for roles in embedded audio and was immediately interested in the concept of next-generation audio wearables. I believe the company’s current position (having pioneered wireless earbuds and now leading in AI-powered platforms) aligns well with my desire to deepen my existing skills and take on new challenges with emerging technology.

It’s clear that the team is focused on building a smart, reliable, and flexible platform that delivers real value to customers, and I’m eager to contribute to projects like this. 
I can see that achieving this will involve close collaboration across functions and a strong focus on testing infrastructure, both of which align closely with what I’m looking for in my next role.

\lettersection{Why Me?}

My extensive experience as embedded software engineer across multiple industries and my particular speciality in audio technology makes me a great candidate for the role. 
With a strong foundation in low-level C and electronics, I’m comfortable reading datasheets, implementing drivers and working with laboratory equipment. I am also capable of architecting embedded solutions at a higher-level in an RTOS context allowing me to contribute meaningfully to platform design where necessary.
In all of my roles I have been an active participant in developing agile ways-of-working and feel at home working in a Kanban style team.

In my role at Sportable I worked extensively with a complex wireless communication protocol and I beleive this experience would transfer well to working with bluetooth enabled products.
During the launch of our product at podpoint I spent considerable time working with frontend, backend and customer-service teams to resolve live issues. This experience would provide a great basis to work closely with mobile developers.
I have worked in and supported a variety of production environments; from bespoke "in-house" at Meridian, delivering modular testing solutions during a significant scale-up at Sportable, and supporting large scale manufacture at podpoint.
